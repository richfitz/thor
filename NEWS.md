## 1.1.0

* Bug fix release fixing several QA problems (#10, #13)
* Add support for large hashes (#12, @artemklevtsov)
* Duplicated data support has been removed, at least temporarily, due to undefined behaviour being found (#11).  I do not believe that anyone is currently using this functionality, but if you were get in touch.

## 1.0.1

* Initial CRAN release
