# There are two ways of achiving this; one is to simply list:

OBJECTS = \
   lmdb/mdb.o \
   lmdb/midl.o \
   registration.o \
   thor.o \
   util.o

# We need to make sure to clean up the .o files within the
# subdirectory though.

# And the other is to do

# PKG_LIBS = -Llmdb -llmdb $(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS)
# $(SHLIB): lmdb/liblmdb.a
# lmdb/liblmdb.a:
# 	@(cd lmdb && $(MAKE) liblmdb.a \
# 	  CC="$(CC)" CFLAGS="$(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS)" AR="$(AR)")

# But I am having some trouble with the linking there, with the
# library not being found and linked in correctly.
